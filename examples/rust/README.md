# Rust
Rust was developed when people at Mozilla got tired of Firefox crashing from memory-handling issues in C code. It features a unique ownership model regulating how memory may be accessed, which has now made Firefox the most stable browser. Rust has been voted most loved language for the past six years in Stack Overflow's annual developer survey. That's got to pique your interest, although be prepared to fight the borrow-checker until you reach enlightenment.
